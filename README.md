# mercari-case-study
INTRODUCTION:

Mercari is an e-commerce marketplace. It is platform where you can buy or sell things.Both sellers and buyers are real people, and they aren't retailers, which means that there is no guarantee that the people buying and selling on it are legitimate.Users upload products that are new/refurbished with their details like description of the product,category name, brand name, item condition and price Users can choose to quote their own price. Now, this becomes a challenge as the price varies based on the products and seasons.So, suggesting a price for that product based on information entered  would make users job easy.This case study is about suggesting the price of the product based on information entered. 

In this case study, I have tested with different models and got scores for every model in kaggle.My submisison is in top 15%.The case study notebook has all the preprocessing and EDA and different models. The final.ipynb notebook has the final model that is deployed via flask app.
